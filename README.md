# Welcome to Krixik!

Sequentially assembling multiple AI models into a single pipeline can be painful and expensive. Consuming even a single model can often be draining.

That's why we're here. **Welcome to Krixik**, where you can easily assemble and serverlessly consume modular AI pipelines through secure APIs.

## Quickstart Guide

### Account Registration

Krixik is currently in beta, so access to the Krixik Python client is by request only.

If you'd like to participate as a beta tester, please complete [this brief Google form](https://forms.gle/RyBAvjN1HEWPScb67).

### Install Krixik

Run the following command to install the Krixik Python client:

```pip
pip install krixik
```

Note: Python version 3.8 or higher is required.


### Initialize your Session

To [initialize](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/initialization/initialize_and_authenticate/) your Krixik client session you will need your unique `api_key` and `api_url` secrets.  Beta testers will receive their secrets from Krixik admin.

Instead of handling your secrets directly, we strongly recommend storing them in an `.env` file and loading them via [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

Once you have your secrets, [initialize](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/initialization/initialize_and_authenticate/) your session as follows:


```python
from krixik import krixik
krixik.init(api_key=MY_API_KEY, 
            api_url=MY_API_URL)
```

...where  `MY_API_KEY` and `MY_API_URL` are your account secrets.

If you've misplaced your secrets, please reach out to us directly.

### Building your First Pipeline

[Let's build a simple transcription pipeline consisting of a single `transcribe` module.](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/single_module_pipelines/single_transcribe/) We can [create](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/pipeline_creation/create_pipeline/) the pipeline with a single line of code:

```python
# create a simple transcription pipeline
pipeline = krixik.create_pipeline(name='my_transcribe-pipeline-1', 
                                  module_chain=["transcribe"])
```

The pipeline is ready! Now you can [process](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method/) audio and video files through it to generate transcripts of them.

```python
pipeline.process(local_file_path='./path/to/my/mp3/or/mp4')
```

The outputs of [this pipeline](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/single_module_pipelines/single_transcribe/) will be a timestamped transcript of your input audio/video file, a `file_id` for the processed file, and a `request_id` for the process itself.


### Extending your Pipeline

[Suppose you wanted to immediately perform vector search on `transcribe` module output.](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_semantically_searchable_transcription/)

You would need to do the following after transcription:

1.  *Transform* the transcript into a text file
2.  *Parse* the text using a sliding window, chunking it into (possibly overlapping) snippets
3.  *Embed* each snippet using an appropriate text embedder
4.  *Store* the resulting vectors in a vector database
5.  *Index* said database
6.  *Enable* vector search on the database

Locally creating and testing this sequence of steps would be time consuming—orchestrating them in a secure production service even more so. And that's without trying to make the entire process serverless.

With **Krixik**, however, you can rapidly incorporate this functionality to your earlier pipeline by just adding a few modules. Syntax remains as above, so [making](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/pipeline_creation/create_pipeline/) the new pipeline still takes one line:

```python
# create pipeline with the above-alluded-to modules
pipeline = krixik.create_pipeline(name='transcribe_vsearch', 
                                  module_chain=["transcribe",
                                                "json-to-txt",
                                                "parser", 
                                                "text-embedder", 
                                                "vector-db"])
```

Let's [process](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method/) a file through your new pipeline.

```python
pipeline.process(local_file_path='./path/to/my/mp3/or/mp4')
```

Now that there is at least one file in [the pipeline](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_semantically_searchable_transcription/), you can use the file's `file_id`—which was returned at the end of the above process—to perform semantic search on the associated transcript with [`.semantic_search`](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/system/search_methods/semantic_search_method/):

```python
pipeline.semantic_search(query="The text you wish to semantically search for goes here",
                         file_ids=['the_file_id_from_above'])
```

That's it! You have now transcribed a file, processed the transcript, performed vector search on it, and can reuse [the pipeline](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_semantically_searchable_transcription/) for as many files and queries as you like... all of it in a couple of minutes and with a few lines of code.

### Optional: Pull the [Krixik Docs Repo](https://github.com/krixik-ai/krixik-docs)

If you wish to follow along with the above example, or with any other of the score of examples we lay out in the documentation, then simply pull the entire [Krixik Docs repo](https://github.com/krixik-ai/krixik-docs).

Doing so will provide you with every file you need, and code will already be configured to run in that directory structure.

## What can you build with Krixik?

The [range of examples](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/pipeline_examples_overview/) we've documented for you include pipelines to:

- ...generate an image caption for a set of images and then perform keyword search on the caption set.
  - [Pipeline: [Caption → JSON-to-TXT → Keyword Database]](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_keyword_searchable_image_captions/)
- ...transcribe a trove of documents, translate them to English, and then run sentiment analysis on each one.
  - [Pipeline: [Transcribe → Translate → JSON-to-TXT → Parser → Sentiment Analysis]](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/multi_module_non_search_pipeline_examples/multi_sentiment_analysis_on_translated_transcription/)
- ...easily and serverlessly consume your open-source OCR model of choice.
  - [Pipeline: [OCR]](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/single_module_pipelines/single_ocr/)

This is only the tip of the iceberg. Many more pipelines are currently possible ([see here for more examples](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/examples/pipeline_examples_overview/)), and the Krixik module/model library will constantly be expanding—perhaps even to include modules/models [of your own submission](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/latest/modules/adding_your_own_modules_or_models/).

## Further Detail - Documentation

The above is just a peek at the power of Krixik. In addition to all possible parameterization (which we didn't even touch on), the Krixik toolbox is an ever-growing collection of modules and models for you to build with.
