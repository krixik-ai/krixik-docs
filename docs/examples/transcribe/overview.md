## transcribe-centric pipelines: overview

This collection of pipelines implements a range of functionality centering on transcription.  That is, where the [`transcribe` module](modules/transcribe.md) is central to the functional outcome of the desired pipeline.

Each can be constructed in just a few minutes with a proper arrangement of currently available [modules](/modules/overview.md).

These example pipelines include:

- [semantically searchable transcription](examples/transcribe/transcribe-semantic.md): learn how to build a modular pipeline that takes in an audio/video file, transcribes it, and makes the result semantically searchable.

- [transcription with multilingual translation](examples/transcribe/transcribe-multilingual.md): learn how to build of a modular pipeline that takes in an audio/video file, transcribes it, and makes the result semantically searchable.

- [semantically searchable multilingual transcription](examples/transcribe/transcribe-multilingual-semantic.md): learn how to build of a modular pipeline that takes in an audio/video file, transcribes it, translates the transcription into a desired language, and makes the result semantically searchable.

- [transcription to sentiment analysis](examples/transcribe/transcribe-sentiment.md): learn how to build a modular pipeline that takes in an audio/video file, transcribes it, and performs sentiment analysis on each sentence of the output transcription.
