    "## Multi-Module Pipeline: Recursive Summarization\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical way to achieve short and abstract (but representative) summaries of long or medium-length documents is to apply summarization *recursively*.  This concept was discussed in our overview of the single-module [`summarize` pipeline](../single_module_pipelines/single_summarize.md), where we applied a single [`summarize`](../../modules/ai_modules/summarize_module.md) module pipeline several times to create terser and terser summary representations of an input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursively summarizing thus facilitates a quicker understanding of key ideas across different levels of detail. This approach is useful for creating hierarchical summaries, optimizing information retrieval, and providing varying levels of detail depending on user needs or application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we reproduce the same result via a pipeline consisting of multiple [`summarize`](../../modules/ai_modules/summarize_module.md) modules in immediate succession. Processing files through this pipeline recursively summarizes with a single pipeline invocation. If you require further summarization, you can build a similar pipeline with more [`summarize`](../../modules/ai_modules/summarize_module.md) modules in it.\n",
