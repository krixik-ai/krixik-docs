    "A practical way to achieve short and abstract (but representative) summaries of long or medium-length documents is to apply summarization *recursively*.  This concept was discussed in our overview of the single-module [`summarize` pipeline](../single_module_pipelines/single_summarize.md), where we applied a single [`summarize`](../../modules/ai_modules/summarize_module.md) module pipeline several times to create terser and terser summary representations of an input text.\n",

Processing files through this pipeline recursively summarizes with a single pipeline invocation. If you require further summarization, you can build a similar pipeline with more [`summarize`](../../modules/ai_modules/summarize_module.md) models in it.\n",
