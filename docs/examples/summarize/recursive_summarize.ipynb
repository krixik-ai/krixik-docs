    "One of the most practical ways to achieve a short, abstract, but representative summary of a long document is to apply summarization *recursively*.  This concept was discussed in our introduction to the [`summarize` module](modules/summarize.md#recursive-summarization).  There we applied a single `summarize` module pipeline several times to create terser and terser summary representations of an input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document we reproduce the same result via a pipeline consisting of multiple [`summarize`](modules/summarize.md) modules in immediate succession.  Processing files through this pipeline applies `summarize` recursively with a single pipeline invocation.\n",
