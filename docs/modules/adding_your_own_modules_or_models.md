[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ VersiÃ³n en espaÃ±ol de este documento](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/es-main/modulos/agrega_tus_propios_modulos_o_modelos/)

Is there a module or model you would like to add to Krixik? Perhaps you:

- Have developed an AI model that you'd like to productionize through Krixik for seamless consumption and pipelining.

- Have fine-tuned a popular open-source model on your own data and now wish to easily put it to use.

- Need to leverage a certain function and you'd like to see it as a Krixik module.

The Krixik library is always expanding, and your model or module idea will be a welcome addition to it.

Please reach out to us at `info@krixik.com` and we'll get started!
