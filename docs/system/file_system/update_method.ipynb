    "- `symbolic_directory_path` (optional, str) - A UNIX-formatted directory path under your account in the Krixik system.\n",

Note that you must update the whole set, so if a file has three file tags and you update one of them, entirely excluding the other two from the `update` method `file_tags` argument, both of those will be deleted.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Note that in the example above we updated `file_tags` by including the entire set of file tags: `[{\"author\": \"Shelley\"}, {\"country\": \"UK\"}, {\"century\": 19}]`. If we'd only used `[{\"country\": \"UK\"}]`, the \"author\" and \"century\" ones would have been deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot update a `symbolic_directory_path`/`file_name` combination (a.k.a. a `symbolic_file_path`) so it's identical to that of another file. Krixik will not allow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also not update a file's file extension. For instance, a `.txt` file cannot become a `.pdf` file through the `update` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `update` method allows you to extend a file's [`expire_time`](../parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method.md#core-process-method-arguments) indefinitely. Upon initially uploading a file, its [`expire_time`](../parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method.md#core-process-method-arguments) cannot be greater than 2,592,000 seconds (30 days). However, if you periodically invoke `update` on its file and reset its [`expire_time`](../parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method.md#core-process-method-arguments) to another 2,592,000 seconds (or however many seconds you please), the file will remain on-system for that much more time as of that moment, and so forth."
