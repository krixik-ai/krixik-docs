    "### `list` Method Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The `list` method is very versatile. It allows you to list by several different metadata items and by a combination of different metadata items.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the following arguments are optional. However, you must use at least one argument for the `list` method to function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a refresher on file system metadata arguments please visit the [`process` method overview](../parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method.md). The metadata arguments you can use for `list` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `file_ids`: A list of one or several `file_id`s to return records for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `file_names`: A list of  one or several `file_name`s to return records for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `symbolic_directory_paths`: A list of one or several `symbolic_directory_path`s to return records for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `symbolic_file_paths`: A list of one or several `symbolic_file_path`s to return records for.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `file_tags`: A list of one or several `file_tag`s to return records for. Note that individual file_tags suffice; if a file has several file tags and you include at least one of them as a `list` argument, that file's record will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use wildcard operators with `file_names`, `symbolic_directory_paths`,`symbolic_file_paths`, and `file_tags` to retrieve records whose exact metadata you don't remember—or if you wish to retrieve records for a group of files that share similar metadata. More on wildcards operators [later](#wildcard-operator-arguments) in this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also list by timestamp bookends. The `list` method accepts timestamps based on both the creation and latest-update times of your records. These are strings in the `\"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\"` format, or alternatively just in the `\"YYYY-MM-DD\"` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `created_at_start`: Filters out all files whose `created_at` time is earlier than what you've specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `created_at_end`: Filters out all files whose `created_at` time is after what you've specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `last_updated_start`: Filters out all files whose `last_updated` time is earlier than what you've specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `last_updated_end`: Filters out all files whose `last_updated` time is after what you've specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples on how to use metadata and timestamps in the `list` method are included below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that file system metadata arguments operate on **OR** logic: for instance, if you `list` by `file_names`, `file_ids`, and `file_tags`, any file that is a match for any of these will be returned. However, timestamp arguments operate on **AND** logic; all files returned must respect the given timestamp bookends. If two timestamp bookends are given and there is no overlap between them, the `list` method will return nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `list` method takes two additional optional arguments to help you organize your output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_files` (int): Determines the maximum number of file records `list` should return. Defaults to none.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sort_order` (str): Specifies how results should be sorted. The two valid values for this argument are 'ascending' and 'descending' (in reference to creation timestamp). Defaults to 'descending'."
