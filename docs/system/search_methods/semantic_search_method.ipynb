    "## The `semantic_search` Method\n",
    "[ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Spanish version of this document](https://krixik-docs.readthedocs.io/es-main/sistema/metodos_de_busqueda/metodo_semantic_search_busqueda_semantica/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Krixik's `semantic_search` method enables semantic (a.k.a. vector) search on documents processed through certain pipelines. Much has been written about semantic search, but in a nutshell, instead of searching a document for specific keywords, it searches for text similar in _meaning_ to the string that's been queried for. Contrast this to [keyword search](keyword_search_method.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the `semantic_search` method both [embeds](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) the query and performs the search, it can only be used with pipelines containing both a [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) module and a [`vector-db`](../../modules/database_modules/vector-db_module.md) module in immediate succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview of the `semantic_search` method is divided into the following sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [semantic_search Method Arguments](#semantic_search-method-arguments)\n",
    "- [Example Pipeline Setup and File Processing](#example-pipeline-setup-and-file-processing)\n",

    "### `semantic_search` Method Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The `semantic_search` method takes one required argument and at least one of several optional arguments. The required argument is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `query` (str) - A string whose meaning will be searched for across the target document. The closest matches (i.e. snippets of text that most match the query in meaning) will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optional arguments are the same arguments that the [`list`](../file_system/list_method.md) method takesâ€”both metadata and timestamp bookendsâ€”so please take a moment to [review them here](../file_system/list_method.md#list-method-arguments). As with the [`list`](../file_system/list_method.md) method, you can semantically search across several files at the same time because all metadata arguments are submitted to the `semantic_search` method in list format. All optional argument elements are the same as for the [`list`](../file_system/list_method.md) method, including the wildcard operator and the global root.\n",
    "\n",
    "If none of these optional arguments is present, the `semantic_search` method will not work because there will be nothing to search through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the [`list`](../file_system/list_method.md) method, the `semantic_search` method also accepts the optional `max_files` and `sort_order` arguments, though their function changes a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_files` - Specifies up to how many files should be searched through. Default is none.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sort_order` - Here takes three possible values: 'ascending', descending', and now 'global'. The first two sort results by the file they're in (the files are sorted by the creation timestamp of the file), and 'global' combines all files and returns the very best results across all files. Default is 'descending'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `semantic_search` method accepts one optional argument that is unique to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `k` (int) - Specifies up to how many results will be returned per queried file. Default is 5."
