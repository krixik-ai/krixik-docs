If the file doesn't follow this format, the [`process`](../parameters_processing_files_through_pipelines/process_method.md) attempt will fail.\n",

    "- The macro container in the JSON file must be a single list.\n",

    "- The list will hold a series of dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- In each dictionary, the text you wish Krixik to pass on to a following module (assuming you click that module into any other) sits as the value of a key-value pair. The key of this pair must be the string `\"snippet\"`. If it is anything else, it will fail or be ignored.\n",
