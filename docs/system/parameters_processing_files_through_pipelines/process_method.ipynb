    "### Selecting Models Via the `modules` Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "The `modules` argument to the `process` method is optional, but through it you can access a wealth of parameterization options. This argument allows you to parameterize how each module operates, **INCLUDING** the determination of (when applicable) what AI model is active within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `modules` argument takes the form of a dictionary with dictionaries within it. On a single-module pipeline it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "modules={'<model name>': {'model':'<model selection>', 'params': <dictionary of parameters>}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that model names are case sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example for a single-module pipeline that holds a [`caption module`](../../modules/ai_modules/caption_module.md) would specifically look like this, `blip-image-captioning-base` being the available model selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "modules={'caption': {'model':'blip-image-captioning-base', 'params': {}}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example `params` is an empty dictionary because [`caption`](../../modules/ai_modules/caption_module.md) module models don't take any parameters. Other types of models do, such as the [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) module models. This is what the `modules` argument might look like for a single-module [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "modules={'text-embedder': {'model':'multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1', 'params': {'quantize': False}}}\n",
    "\n",
    "`quantize` is a parameter that you can set for [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) module models, and only for [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) module models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `modules` argument syntax for multi-module pipelines is similar to the above, but in that case there's one sub-dictionary for every module. For instance, the `modules` argument for a [vector search pipeline](../../examples/search_pipeline_examples/multi_basic_semantic_search.md) that sequentially chains together [`parser`](../../modules/support_function_modules/parser_module.md), [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md), and [`vector-db`](../../modules/database_modules/vector-db_module.md) modules might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "modules={'parser': {'model':'fixed', 'params': {\"chunk_size\": 10, \"overlap_size\": 5}},\n",
    "         'text-embedder': {'model':'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'params': {}},\n",
    "         'vector-db': {'model':'faiss', 'params': {}}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any modules not explicitly called out will take their default values. If you need to specify one module's model or its params, that doesn't mean you need to specify all of them in the pipeline. Consequently, given that in the code immediately above the [`text-embedder`](../../modules/ai_modules/text-embedder_module.md) and [`vector-db`](../../modules/database_modules/vector-db_module.md) modules above are being set to their default values, you could achieve the exact same thing by removing them from the code and only leaving the [`parser`](../../modules/support_function_modules/parser_module.md) module, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "- `symbolic_directory_path` (str) - A UNIX-formatted directory path under your account in the Krixik system. Default is `/etc`.\n",
